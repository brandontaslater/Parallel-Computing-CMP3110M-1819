# Parallel-Computing-CMP3110M-1819
This repository is used for the development of GPU Parallel computing for the searching and sorting of small and large datasets.

# Requirements
Your task is to develop a simple statistical tool for analysing historical weather records from
Lincolnshire. The provided data files include records of air temperature collected over a period of
more than 80 years from five weather stations in Lincolnshire: Barkston Heath, Scampton,
Waddington, Cranwell and Coningsby. Your tool should be able to load the provided dataset and
perform statistical summaries of temperature including the min, max and average values, and standard
deviation. The provided summaries should be performed on the entire dataset regardless their
acquisition time and location. For additional credit, you can also consider the median statistic and its 
1st and 3rd quartiles (i.e. 25th and 75th percentiles) which will require a development of a suitable
sorting algorithm.
